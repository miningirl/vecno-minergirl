Vecno NVIDIA Miner
Overview
This miner is specifically optimized for mining Vecno (VE), a cryptocurrency on the Vecno Blockchain.
It is designed exclusively for NVIDIA GPUs and delivers maximum performance by achieving the highest possible hashrate on all supported NVIDIA graphics cards (from older models to the latest RTX series).
Our goal is to provide miners with the most efficient and reliable tool to maximize their rewards when mining Vecno.
Key Features

High Performance: Tuned kernels for optimal hashrate across a wide range of NVIDIA GPUs.
Compatibility: Supports all modern NVIDIA cards (CUDA-compatible).
Stability: Robust error handling and efficient resource management for long-term mining sessions.

Developer Fee
To support ongoing development, maintenance, and improvements of the miner, a 2.5% developer fee is included.
This fee is fully transparent and operates as follows:

The fee is automatically deducted during mining sessions.
It is evenly split and distributed to two separate wallets (for redundancy and security).
The miner logs clearly and explicitly show when a fee mining session starts and when it ends.

You will see messages in the console/log such as:
text[Fee] Starting devfee mining session...
[Fee] Devfee session completed. Resuming user mining.
This ensures complete visibility — no hidden processes or surprise deductions.
The fee only activates periodically for short periods and never impacts your primary mining rewards beyond the stated 2.5%.
